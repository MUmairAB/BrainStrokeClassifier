# Functionality of the BrainStrokeClassifier
The package includes a trained Machine Learning model to predict Brain Stroke
vulnerability. The model can be accessed as **BStClassifier** utility. You can use **BStClassifier(X)** to make predictions. Where **X** is the input consisting of 7 characteristics:
1. Gender ("Male"=0, "Female"=1, "Other"=-1)
2. Age
3. Do you have hypertension (Yes=1/No=0)
4. Do you have any heart disease (Yes=1/No=0)
5. What type of work you do? ("Private job"=0, "Self Employed"=1, "Govt. Job"=2, "Never Worked"=-2, "You are a Child"=-1)
6. Your average blood glucose level
7. Your Body Mass Index (BMI)

It classifies whether you are vulnerable to or had brain stroke, or not.
 
## Input type
The input can be:
1. NumPy array

         a. 1D array of shape (7,)
         
         b. 2D array of shape (S,7); where S is number of samples
2. Pandas Series of shape (7,)
3. Pandas DataFrame of shape (S,7); where S is number of samples
# About the Machine Learning model
The Machine Learning model is a Pipeline of Strandard Scaler and XGBoost Classifier. You can check the notebook where the model is trained through the [github](https://github.com/MUmairAB/Stroke-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning/blob/a0c9126b4f8c55ea528b1f60354f441148173567/stroke-prediction.ipynb)

# Package Installation
Make sure you have Python installed in your system.
Run Following command in the command window.
 ```
  !pip install BrainStrokeClassifier
  ```
# Example Code

 ```
# test.py


# Package installation
!pip install BrainStrokeClassifier

# Loading package
from BrainStrokeClassifier import BStClassifier
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Creating some test input

x = np.array([[0,67,0,1,0,228.69,36.6],
              [0,58,1,0,0,87.96,39.2]])

df = pd.DataFrame(x)
prediction = BStClassifier(df)
print(prediction)
